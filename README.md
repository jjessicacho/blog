# Comp1850 mid-term project
I created a simple blog site to practice HTML and CSS flexbox. This project is important reference when I need to check how to toggle button animation using JavaScript, responsive layouts and HTML & CSS semantic tags. A note for myself: Do not edit this even if you find errors later.

## Fixing Errors
- Text Alignment for paragraphs in desktop: Center -> Left-side for legibility
